Generically, routes tie as follows:
POST - INSERT into database
GET - SELECT from database
PUT - UPDATE database
DELETE - DELETE from database


Routes we need:
GET - login (mostly done)
POST - create user (mostly done)
POST - add favorite (not started)
PUT - update rating (not started)
 - How will this come in?  Will the ID be in the body or part of the URL?  For now, set as part of the body
GET - get all favorite (not started)
GET - get rating (not started)
